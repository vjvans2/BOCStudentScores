# BOCStudentScores
Two versions of a Scorekeeping application utilizing communication between forms and strongly typed lists within a class.<br>
 - The named version utilizes the Tag property to communicate information between WinForms.<br>
 - The "Using Classes" version does not use classes, but does use methods between WinForms.<br>
<br>

The end goal is to also code this app in ASP.NET, MVC, Java, and every other language I learn.
