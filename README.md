# BOCStudentScores
Two versions of a Scorekeeping application.<br>
 - The named version utilizes the Tag property to communicate information between WinForms.<br>
 - The "Using Classes" version does not use classes, but does use methods between WinForms.<br>
<br>

The goal is to eventually port this app to ASP.NET and/or MVC and Java
